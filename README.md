AudioSwitcher for Bash

This is a script that allows you to swap between audio devices by invoking pactl

This script was written with the help of Google's Gemini AI, along with my own sleuthing on pactl commands and syntax. I am not much of a coder / scripter myself. This was purpose-made for my personal use but I have somewhat genericised the script should anyone else find it useful.

I have this script set to a keyboard shortcut within KDE so I can switch between headphones and speakers with one button press.
